    <h1>Toto, My Love</h1>
    <p>
        I am sorry that I made you sleep like this now, I overreacted on a small and simple thing, and I know it’s my fault. I’m not backing away aw ethajaj, I know what I did and I know that it’s so childish and exhausting dealing with this. I am sorry, and I know these actions could lead you to be upset about me. I know you love me and I know how much you see me, and I know how much if I annoyed you, I might make you sad and maybe lose something.<br><br>
        I will stop interrogating you about simple things. I don’t want to make you sad and become distant from me. I don’t want this to happen. I am really sorry, my love. I know it makes you feel even worse when I understand after klshe happened w kholes. I know klshe diala. I know, my love. I am sorry. I love you, and I made this website for you so you can see it in the morning. The way you spoke to me ekhr she kent new w it terrified me because hl trea means you’re tired from simple and non-existing mshekel that make us in a bad place.<br><br>
        I love you, and I hope this website makes you a bit happier. I am having trouble sleeping because I am thinking a lot. I don’t want to lose something from you nor you. I love you and I’m sorry, mama.<br><br>
        With much love and tenderness,<br>
        Your bitch Hadi
